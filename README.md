## Introduction

Hello, my name is Jonah Rodriguez and I'm new to the field of coding. I've worked in various retail and food service the entirety of my working career. I've been handy with computers from a very young age and new fairly early that I wanted to build a career in the IT field. After having a few colleagues finish the CNM Ingenuity DeepDive bootcamp, I knew that I wanted to learn the Java Coding language and pursue a career in code development. I'm an excellent learner, self-motivated, and always challenging myself in the pursuit of new knowledge.
